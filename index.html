	<h3>About Me</h3>


	<div class="content"><hr noshade>
	<p>At the age of 24, I am many things. I am a son, a brother, an employee, a musician, a student, a teacher, and many others. Today,  I am a person who is currently in a turning point of his life.</p>
	<p>For the past year, I have been working at a healthcare company called ElderServe Health, Inc. We are an MLTC that works like a nursing home and insurance agency, but lets you live in the comfort of your own home. I work in the financial department, where I started doing data entry and some analysis via Microsoft Excel and our own Web Application dealing with medical records. I then worked on the entirely new UAS system which is also a  Web Application run by New York State to register and maintain records of all New York State residents who receive Medicaid benefits and are enrolled in various plans. </p>
	<p>Over the last few months, it has occured to me that the Financial World is not where I want to be. I then decided to look for some new options of what I can do with the rest of my life. That's when I stumbled upon an idea.</p>
	<p>I was talking to a friend of mine, who has always been really into computers and was one of those boy-geniuses you hear about cracking into the school mainframe to steal passwords so we can play virutal mini-golf in the school library, and I told him that I'm looking to make a career change. He said, "To where?" I gave him a shrug and told him I'm not sure, but it's stressing me out. Thats when he suggested to look into computers. Up until that point, I never really took computers seriously as a profession. I don't know why I never gave it much thought, considering I always liked computers and I had a talent for always getting the results I wanted from them, but I just didn't. So I started to probe around and find out more information.</p>
	<p>I started talking to a few people while checking out a few websites. I then found a website called <a href= "http://www.codeacademy.com/">Code Academy</a> and started the JavaScript track to get a feel for coding to see what I was getting myself into. After that first day, I was hooked. Every time I had some time to myself with my computer, I logged-on to learn something new. It became something fun for me, and I was looking forward to the next time I could sit infront of the computer and learn to make new things, as well as make them look better and perform different tasks.</p>
	<p>A week or two goes by, and I then stumble upon an amazing opportunity. A school in my area is not only teaching a stack of languages to help me get started, but its an intensive one-stop-shop that will get me to the level of an entry-level developer by graduation. The kicker is, the whole class only takes 12 weeks. I have heard of there being trade-school type environments for programming where it's not necessary to go after a four year computer science degree, but for one class to really teach an entire stack at once is not only appealing, but it became a must have for me. And that brings me to where I am today. Writing my first webpage to win over the admissions board to advance to the next step in hopes to be accepted.</p>
